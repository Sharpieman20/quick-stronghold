Wrote a new script to find best blind travel distance
The main factors it accounts for in comparison to the old blind travel calculation is i've added parameters to only care about the top X% of luck (with regard to closest stronghold distance upon exiting the portal) as well as a scalable tradeoff (currently 3:1) between blocks traveled in the nether and blocks traveled in the overworld

Here are the preliminary results:
           **RATIO**    5.0    3.0     2.0    1.5    1.0
     **TOP%**
    25
    50
    100                        

Currently running a more in-depth sim (takes some hours to run) and generating some visuals
